== Lesson 8

Because we've been focusing on the structure of the C++ language so far,
we haven't given much attention to getting information in and out of our
program. Today we'll change this, but first, let's take a quick look at
a few niggling details that we've been able to ignore until now.

Scope
~~~~~

This is not to be confused with mouthwash, though considering the
personal hygiene habits of some developers, might not be a bad idea,
either. Luckily, on the Internet, nobody knows you're a cat.

*Scope* in this case applies to variables. A variable's scope is the
span of its existence. When a variable is declared, it has a definite
beginning, and it can't be used before its declaration in the source
code. It also disappears completely when execution reaches the end of
the block in which it is declared.

There are three types of scope: local, global, and static. Local
variables have the shortest lifespan: they are declared within a code
block, such as a function, _for_ loop, or _case_ block, and disappear
when execution leaves the block of code.

Global and static variables are declared outside of a function. They can
always be accessed, but the order in which they are initialized is not
certain, so be careful of globals that depend on the values of other
globals. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere. Static
variables have the same lifetime as global variables, but they can be
accessed only from code within the file in which they are declared. In
other words, code in other files can't get at them. All of this can get
tricky, but it is easier to understand in code, so let's look at an
example.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>


// This is a global variable, accessible from anywhere
int gAppReturnValue = 0;


int AreaOfSquare(int size)
{
	return size * size;
}


int main(void)
{
	int returnValue = 1;

	// We actually start from 1 in this loop because measuring the area
	// of a square of 0 inches is pretty silly.
	for (int i = 1; i <= 12; i++)
	{
		// i is only accessible from within this loop.
		// If we had a need to utilize returnValue, we could do it here.
		int area = AreaOfSquare(i);

		printf("The area of a square %d inches on a side is "
				"%d square inches**\n**",i,area);
	}

	// If we try to access the area variable outside the loop,
	// the compiler will complain with an error something like
	// "foo.cpp:30: error: ‘area’ was not declared in this scope"

	return gAppReturnValue;
}
....

Having seen the above example, you should be aware of what names you
give your variables. The lone global variable in this code has a
lowercase 'g' for a prefix. This is to signify that it is a global.
Static variables use the prefix 's' instead of 'g'. Get into the habit
of using these prefixes to avoid more than a few headaches.

If you're like me, you're probably wondering what kind of headaches I'm
talking about. Take a look at this example and ask yourself what value
would be printed.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>


// This is a static variable, accessible from anywhere in this file
static int returnValue = 1;


int main(void)
{
	int returnValue = 2;

	printf("The return value of this program is %d**\n**",returnValue);

	return returnValue;
}
....

In case you're too lazy to try this sample out, the value is 2. This
could've been easily avoided by naming our static variable
_sReturnValue_. Local variables always receive precedence when there are
conflicts in scope. It's also possible to hide a parameter or a
previously-declared local variable this way, such as a variable in an
_if_ block hiding a variable declared at the beginning of a function.
_Be careful not to hide parameters with the variables you declare in a
function._

Global and static variables are much like spices in cooking: used
sparingly, they can really make writing programs easier, but used too
much, all they will do is help you make a big mess. When in doubt, don't
use global variables to pass data around – use function parameters
instead. Doing so will make it much easier to reuse code that you've
written. Once again, work smarter, not harder.

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

Not everything is subject to being changed in C and C++. Sometimes we
want to ensure that some data not be altered at all. There are other
times when we want to use a variable to remember some arbitrary value –
we don't care what the value itself happens to be, but we do want to
remember its purpose. When we get to writing Haiku programs that use
windows and buttons, we will use these quite a lot to specify behavior
for controls that we use, such as how they will be resized.

The first kind of constant is the preprocessor definition. In case you
don't remember from Lesson 2, the preprocessor is the first tool used
when compiling source code into an executable. The preprocessor removes
comments, includes header files, and other basic text insertion and
substitution. They look like this:

[source,c++]
....
#define SOMEDEF "I like cheese!"
#define STRACE(x) printf x
....

The format is simple: __#define <definition> <what gets put there>__. They
are simple textual substitutions, much like if you opened a word
processor and made it replace all occurrences of SOMEDEF with "I like
cheese!" As far as the compiler is concerned, you never even typed
SOMEDEF. You can even make them look like functions, like STRACE. We'll
look at this one in more detail at the end of the lesson, so just sit
tight on that one.

Even more so than arrays, _#defines_ need to be handled carefully. It is
good practice to put them in all capitals so that they do not look like
functions. They also are not type-aware, and one other word of caution:
no matter how much they beg, no matter how much they cry, never, *NEVER
put a semicolon at the end of a preprocessor definition*.

[source,c++]
....
// Do NOT do this
#define THISISBAD 1;
....

Doing so will result in errors in your code that seemingly have nothing
to do with the real problem. These are the kind of bugs that make you
feel as if you're aging prematurely, even if you're not.

Constant variables are the preferred means of remembering an arbitrary
value because they have a defined type. This is done by placing the
_const_ keyword in the declaration of a variable. Because they are not
allowed to be modified, you will almost always see a constant
initialized when it is declared.

[source,c++]
....
const int someConstantIntValue = 3;
....

Pointers can be made constant, as well, but it gets confusing _very_
quickly if you're not careful. The _const_ keyword can apply to the
pointer's address, to the pointer itself, or both.

[source,c++]
....
// This is just a constant integer that we'll use for some of the pointers below.
const int someVariable = 5;

// These are both pointers to an int where we can change the pointer's address,
// but not its value. These don't have to be initialized.
const int *ptrConstInt;
int const *anotherPtrConstInt;

// This is a constant pointer. The value itself can change, but we can't
// change the address to which the pointer points. It's pretty useless unless
// we initialize it.
int * const constPtrInt = &foo;

// These are constant pointers to a constant value. We can't change ANYTHING
// about it, which means that it has to be initialized to be of any use.
const int * const ptrReallyConstInt = &someVariable;
int const * const anotherPtrReallyConstInt = &someVariable;
....

What a mess! There is a rule of thumb which helps make sense of all of
this confusion. **The __const__ keyword applies to the element to
its left. If there isn't anything there, then it applies to whatever is
to the right.** In the first two examples above, every time you see
_const int_ or _int const_, it means that the pointer itself can be
changed, but not the value in the address that it points to. Every time
you see _* const_, it makes the pointer's address fixed, but the value
at the pointer's address can be changed. The last two examples above
combine these two techniques to make everything constant, both address
and value. If you're still confused on this, don't worry too much – it's
not just you. This is a hard topic.

Using Data From Outside: File Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only way that we know how to get information into our program is
_gets()_, and the only way to get it out is _printf()_. While _printf()_
is just fine, _gets()_ is actually dangerous and whenever the compiler
encounters its use, it warns us. The reason is that there is no way to
enforce how many characters are placed in the string passed to it.
Crashing the program is as easy as typing more characters than the
capacity of the array that is given to it. We're going to move on to a
much better solution.

Moving information in and out of programs is normally done using
streams. Information flows in or out of your program. Direct input from
the user is a stream, and the screen is one also – one for output.
Console programs utilize streams to get and print information, and they
can even be linked together: the program that we use when we run
Terminal, called bash, features an incredibly powerful ability to take
what one program spits out and feed it to another one or dump it into a
file.

There are three main streams that are available to every program:
_stdin_, the standard input, _stdout_, the standard output, and
_stderr_, the error output. Unless changed, a program that gets data
from _stdin_ will ask for input from the user just like we've done with
_gets()_ and sending anything to _stdout_ or _stderr_ will be printed on
the screen.

Data can be brought into our programs by reading from a stream, and it
can be sent out of our program by writing to one. Some streams are
read-only, some are write-only, and some allow both reading and writing.
_stdin_ is read-only, so we can use it only for getting data. _stdout_
and _stderr_ are write-only, so we can only print to them. If we create
a stream to operate on a file, we can choose either or both.

Each stream has an identifier, called a *handle*. In programming, a
handle is just an arbitrary – but most often unique – number which is
used to identify an object from others of its kind. Operating on a
stream is as simple as obtaining a handle for the stream and calling the
appropriate function. Let's take a look at the declarations for some of
the functions that we will use in day-to-day C programming.

[source,c++]
....
int printf(const char *format, ...);
int fprintf(FILE *streamHandle, const char *format, ...);
....

An old standard. Given a string which defines the format for what is to
be printed and an appropriate number of parameters afterward, prints a
string to _stdout_. _fprintf()_ requires a stream handle to be specified
before the format string – making it possible to "print" directly to a
file – but otherwise working exactly like _printf()_. When successful,
both functions return the number of characters printed. A negative
return value is used to indicate failure.

[source,c++]
....
int ferror(FILE *streamHandle);
....

This returns a 0 if everything is OK on the stream indicated by
_streamHandle_ and some other unspecified value if an error has
occurred. Make sure that _streamHandle_ is not _NULL_ – it will segfault
your program otherwise.

[source,c++]
....
int feof(FILE *streamHandle);
....

This returns a 0 if everything is OK on the stream indicated by
_streamHandle_ and some other unspecified value if the stream has come
to the end of the file. Make sure that _streamHandle_ is not _NULL_ – it
will segfault your program otherwise.

[source,c++]
....
char * fgets(char *array, int arraySize, FILE *streamHandle);
....

_fgets()_ is the safe version of _gets()_. It reads in text from the
stream handle until it encounters an endline (_'\n'_) character or it
reads the number of characters equal to _arraySize_, making a
segmentation fault possible if the programmer makes a mistake. As with
_gets(),_ when successful, _fgets()_ returns the same pointer as
_array_. If there is an error, it returns a _NULL_ pointer. If _fgets()_
comes to the end of the file – only encountered when reading from a file
instead of _stdin_ – the contents of the array remain unchanged and a
_NULL_ pointer is returned. Whenever a _NULL_ pointer is returned by
_fgets()_, use _feof()_ and _ferror()_ to figure out whether you have
run out of data or something has gone wrong.

[source,c++]
....
FILE * fopen(const char *filePath, const char *mode);
....

_fopen()_ opens a file as a stream. If successful, it returns a stream
handle which is used by other functions and must be eventually closed
with _fclose()_. The mode strings are listed below.

[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|Mode string |Function

|"r" |Open a file for reading. The file has to exist.

|"w" |Open a file for writing. If the file exists, its contents are
erased and it is treated as a new empty file.

|"a" |Open a file for writing. Any data written to it is added to the
end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it is created

|"r+" |Open a file for updating, supporting both reading and writing.
The file must already exist.

|"w+" |Open a file for updating, supporting both reading and writing. If
the file exists, its contents are erased and it is treated as a new
empty file.

|"a+" |Open a file for reading and appending. Reading can be done from
anywhere in the file, but all writes are tacked onto the end of the
file.
|=======================================================================

[source,c++]
....
int fclose(FILE *streamHandle);
....

Close up an opened stream handle.

Wow. That's a lot of different functions! The scary part is that this is
only a very small portion of the functions available. A programmer
should always be learning. Once he is comfortable with a language, he is
often learning about available functions that are new to him and new
ways to use the functions that he knows. The best way to learn how to
use functions that are new to you is to use them.

Let's have a look at a program which prints a test file to _stdout_ and
creates that file if necessary.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>

int
FileExists(const char *path)
{
	// This function tests for the existence of a file by trying
	// to open it. There are better ways of doing this, but this
	// will work well enough for our purposes for now.
	// If we were given a NULL pointer, we will return a -1 to
	// indicate an error condition.

	if (!path)
		return -1;

	// Attempt to open the file for reading
	FILE *file = fopen(path,"r");

	// our return value will be 1 if the file exists and 0 if
	// it doesn't. ferror() will return a nonzero result if
	// there was a problem opening the file and a 0 if the file
	// opened OK.

	int returnValue;

	// ferror will crash if given a NULL pointer
	if (!file || ferror(file) != 0)
		returnValue = 0;
	else
	{
		fclose(file);
		returnValue = 1;
	}

	return returnValue;
}


int
MakeTestFile(const char *path)
{
	// Always check for NULL pointers when dealing with strings
	if (!path)
		return -1;

	// Open the file and erase the contents if it already exists.
	FILE *file = fopen(path,"w");
	if (!file || ferror(file))
	{
		// We have a different error code if we couldn't create the
		// file. This makes it possible for us to know if we messed up
		// by passing a NULL pointer or if there was a file-related error.
		fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't create the file %s**\n**",path);

		return 0;
	}

	// The stream handles for stdout, stdin, and stderr are already defined
	// for us, so we can use them without any extra work, like in the if()
	// condition above and where we put data into our file below.

	fprintf(file, "This is a file.\nThis is only a file.\n"
			"Had this been a real emergency, do you think I'd "
			"be around to tell you?\n");

	fclose(file);

	return 1;
}


int
main(void)
{
	int returnValue = 0;

	// Let's use a test file in /boot/home called MyTestFile.txt.
	const char *filePath = "/boot/home/MyTestFile.txt";

	// Make the test file if it doesn't already exist and bail out of
	// our program entirely if there is a problem creating it.
	if (!FileExists(filePath))
	{
		returnValue = MakeTestFile(filePath);

		if (returnValue != 1)
			return returnValue;
	}

	printf("Printing file %s:\n",filePath);

	// We got this far, so it's safe to print the file
	FILE *file = fopen(filePath,"r");

	if (!file || ferror(file))
	{
		fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't print the file %s\n",filePath);
		return 0;
	}

	char inString[1024];

	// fgets will return a NULL pointer when it reaches the end of the
	// file, so this little loop will print the entire file and quit
	// at its end.

	while (fgets(inString,1024,file))
		fprintf(stdout,"%s",inString);

	fclose(file);

	return 0;
}
....

Whew! This is our longest example yet. It's also our closest code to a
"real" program. Some idioms, like _if (!file)_, are very common to C and
C++ programming, so get used to seeing them. Read over the code in this
example and make sure that you understand what each line does.

There are some small changes in the style, as well. Attention to good
style is a quirk of the Haiku ecosystem. The Haiku developers, in
particular, are notably picky about code which adheres to the
OpenTracker code style guidelines and with good reason. Style is partly
a matter of opinion, but good code style can also help with debugging
and avoiding errors. Bad code style can make it much, much harder. The
style we will use throughout the rest of these lessons does not hold to
the official Haiku guidelines in certain ways, but it does follow them
pretty closely.

Answers from Lesson 7's Bug Hunt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  The pointer _combinedString_ doesn't point to a valid memory
address. It needs to either be given heap memory by _malloc()_ – which
is later freed – or declared on the stack as an array.
2.  The size of _binaryString_ array in _main()_ is too small. It needs
to be at least big enough to hold 1 character per bit in a byte plus 1
for the _NULL_ terminator, so _binaryString_ must be at least 9
characters instead of 6.
