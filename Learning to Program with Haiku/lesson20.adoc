Learning to Program with Haiku

Lesson 20

Written by DarkWyrm

All material © 2010 DarkWyrm

Although our focus in the last few lessons has been on the Interface Kit, another kit receives quite a lot of attention when programming in Haiku: the Storage Kit. This kit is devoted to working with files and folders on disk. We'll be doing a fast and furious crash course through it today. Don't worry, though – it's not very difficult.

== Overview of the Storage Kit

The kit can be divided into six basic groups of classes.

[cols=",",]
|===
|BFilePanel |A GUI control used to navigate the filesystem and select a file or folder
|BRefFilter |A class for filtering _entry_ref_ objects. It is almost always used in combination with BFilePanel.
| |
|BQuery |Run a search of the filesystem using attributes. Queries work only on BFS volumes.
| |
|BVolume |This is a class which represents a disk volume, which can be a hard disk partition, removable drive, disk image, or network share.
|BVolumeRoster |This class provides the means to get information on all volumes available on the system.
| |
|BDirectory |BDirectory is a very useful class. It gives you ways to read the contents of a directory, create files, folders, and symbolic links, and it can find a specific entry, such as to ascertain if it exists.
|BEntry |This is one of the most-used classes in the Storage Kit. It represents an item in a directory, such as a file or folder. A BEntry can tell you if a path exists, delete it, move it to somewhere else on the same volume, and more.
|BEntryList |You won't probably ever use a BEntryList directly. It is a class used to define an interface for reading lists of BEntry objects that derived classes must implement. Currently BQuery and BDirectory are the only objects that do this.
|BFile |BFile is another commonly-used class. Unsurprisingly, it represents a file on disk and provides functionality to read data from files and write to them. It provides a friendlier interface than _fread()_ and friends. Like BDirectory, it is a child class of BNode, inheriting all of its attribute-related functions.
|BNode |A BNode represents the data part of a file. The class provides functions for file locking and working with a file's attributes.
|BNodeInfo |Although BNode can do everything BNodeInfo does, BNodeInfo provides an easy interface to common attribute tasks, such as getting a file's type. Of particular note is the static function _GetTrackerIcon()_, which is used to get the icon that would be shown in Tracker.
|BPath |BPath gives you simple string path manipulation functions. It doesn't do many of the fancy tricks BString does, but it does do path-specific ones, like converting relative paths to absolute ones and appending entry names.
|BStatable |This provides a friendly interface to the information provided by the _stat()_ function, including entry type (file, directory, etc.), creation time, modification time, file owner, and more. It isn't used directly, though. BStatable is a pure abstract class, intended to create an interface implemented by child classes. BNode and BEntry are both child classes of BStatable.
|BSymLink |BSymLink is next to useless. The only useful function is _ReadLink()_, but because BSymLink is a child of BNode, it doesn't know where it is in the filesystem. The link resolution functions provided by BEntry are much more convenient.
| |
|BAppFileInfo |This class isn't used very often unless you're developing an IDE, file browser, or something similar. It is used for getting and setting information specific to applications, such as version number, icons, supported types, and so on.
|BMimeType |It won't be often that you'll use this class. It's for parsing MIME strings, getting access to the File Type database, and performing related tasks. The main thing that this is used for is setting the preferred application for a file type.
|BResources |Like BAppFileInfo, you probably won't ever use this class unless you're writing a specific kind of app, such as a resource editor. It is for programmatically loading, adding, or deleting program resources.
| |
|The Node Monitor |Not actually a class, the Node Monitor is a service of the Storage Kit which can notify you of changes in the filesystem, such as when a volume is mounted or unmounted, when a file is created or deleted, or when the contents of a directory changes.
|===

== Project

Using the Interface Kit does have one drawback: if you use one part of it, you almost always have to use the whole paradigm. For example, if you want to load a BBitmap from disk, you have to have a valid BApplication, even if you don't use it. The Storage Kit doesn't have this limitation. In fact, today's project is a simple console application which is simple enough for a lesson but is coded in a style that you would find in a regular Haiku application.

This project, called ListDir, is a simple version of the bash command _ls_. Given a path specified on the command line, our program will list the contents of the directory and the size of each entry in the directory. We will display the "size" of any subdirectories by listing how many entries the subdirectory has.

#include <Directory.h>

#include <Entry.h>

#include <Path.h>

#include <stdio.h>

#include <String.h>

// It's better to use constant global integers instead of #defines because

// constants provide strong typing and don't lead to weird errors like #defines

// can.

return 0;

return 1;

// Calling Rewind() moves the BDirectory's index to the beginning of the

// will enable us to get certain information about each entry, such as the

// entry's size. Also, because it inherits from BStatable, we can

// differentiate between directories and files with just one function call.

while (dir.GetNextEntry(&entry) == B_OK)

\{

char name[B_FILE_NAME_LENGTH];

entry.GetName(name);

BString formatString;

formatString << "%s";

unsigned int length = strlen(name);

== Going Further

With what we now know about the Interface and Storage Kits, there is a lot that is possible. You might want to go back and expand on a previous project and see what you can do with it. If you haven't tried starting a project of your own yet, this might be a time to seriously consider one. If not, very soon we will spend more than one lesson on a project the size of which you might see in the real world to tie in everything we've been learning.
