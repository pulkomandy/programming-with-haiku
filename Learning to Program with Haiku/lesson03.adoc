== Lesson 3

So far we've been learning about programming basics, such as how to write a function and how to start looking for bugs in our code. This time we'll be learning about different types of data and ways to store and pass it around.

There is only so much that can be done with direct manipulation like `return 1 + 1;` which is why we have *variables* in programming. A variable is simply a storage container for information, and just like any real world container, they come in different shapes, sizes, and uses.

Creating a variable is merely a matter of declaring its existence, as seen below.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	// Declaring one integer variable named a
	int a;

	// Declaring two at once: b and c
	int b, c;

	a = 1;
	b = 2;
	c = 3;

	// print out the values of our variables
	printf("a is %d, b is %d, and c is %d.\n", a, b, c);

	return a + b + c;
}
....

Variables can be declared one at a time, such as our variable `a`, or several at once, like `b` and `c`. In addition to declaring variables for our use in functions, many times we'll get them for free because many functions require input data to do their work. These variables are called *parameters* or *arguments*.

Function parameters are declared both in a function's declaration and definition. They are listed in a comma-separated list. Functions which do not take any arguments use the word `void` to say so.

[source,c++]
....
// Declaration of a function with two arguments.
int SomeFunction(int someNumber, int anotherNumber);

// Definition of a function with two arguments.
int MultiplyNumbers(int value, int secondValue)
{
	return value * secondValue;
}

// A function which needs no arguments. Must be a really peaceful one.
int main(void)
{
	return MultiplyNumbers(2, 3);
}
....

When we call a function with parameters, such as `MultiplyNumbers()` in the above example, we don't list the type beside each one. The compiler keeps track of the types and warns us when we make mistakes.

Speaking of types, there are more types of data than just integers in C++. Each type takes up a different amount of space in memory, measured in bytes. This is important to remember because the number of bytes a variable occupies has a direct impact on how much information it can hold. This difference is evident in the range of values a `char` can hold as opposed to a `short`. Type sizes vary from platform to platform, but here is a pretty good list for Haiku on a 32-bit processor.

[cols=",,,",]
|==========================================================================================================================
|Type 				|Size (bytes) 	|Range 								|Description
|char 				|1 				|-128 to 127 						|Letters – each char variable only holds 1 letter
|unsigned char 		|1 				|0 to 255 							|Letters – each char variable only holds 1 letter

|short 				|2 				|–32,768 to 32,767 					|Whole numbers

|unsigned short 	|2 				|0 to 65, 535 						|Whole numbers

|int 				|4 				|–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 	|Whole numbers

|unsigned int 		|4 				|0 to 4,294,967,295 				|Whole numbers

|long 				|4 				|–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 	|Whole numbers

|long long 			|8 				|–9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |Whole numbers

|unsigned long long |8 				|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 	|Whole numbers

|float 				|4 				|3.4E +/- 38 (7 digits) 			|Numbers with a fractional part (floating point)

|double 			|8 				|1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits) 			|Numbers with a fractional part (floating point)

|long double 		|12 			| 									|Numbers with a fractional part (floating point)

|bool 				|1 				|True or false 						|True or false

|wchar_t 			|2 or 4 		|As either `short` or `int` 		|“Wide” characters, which can support international characters. As with `char`, each variable only holds 1 letter.
|==========================================================================================================================

Using printf()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now do you remember the weirdness that we saw a little bit ago with `printf()`? Let's take another look at it.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int a;
	int b, c;

	a = 1;
	b = 2;
	c = 3;

	printf("a is %d, b is %d, and c is %d.\n", a, b, c);

	return a + b + c;
}
....

`printf` is one of a few functions which take a variable number of arguments. Its first parameter is always a string. Depending on the number of placeholders in the string, though, it may or may not have additional parameters following the string. For example, in our above example, the string has three `%d` placeholders, one each for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Three placeholders, three “extra” parameters. Here are some other possible placeholders for `printf` that we'll use later on. Note that this is not an exhaustive list to `printf` – there are many more options, but these will suffice for now.

[cols=",,",]
|============================================================
|Placeholder|Type 							|Sample output
|%c 		|Character 						|a
|%d, %i 	|Signed decimal integer 		|234
|%e, %E 	|Scientific notation using e/E 	|1.7e+5, 1.7E+5
|%f 		|Floating point number 			|3.14
|%g 		|Double precision number 		|3.14
|%o 		|Integer in octal notation 		|711
|%u 		|Unsigned integer 				|255
|%x, %X 	|Integer in hexadecimal notation|0xff, 0xFF
|%% 		|Percent sign 					|%
|============================================================

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

Operators give us ways of working with variables and numbers without calling functions. `+`, `-`, and `*` are all examples of operators, but C++ has many more than just these. Here are the arithmetic operators that we'll need for now.

[cols=",,",]
|=======================================================================
|a + b |addition |adds b to a

|a - b |subtraction |subtracts b from a

|a * b |multiplication |multiplies a by b

|a / b |division |divides a by b

|a % b |modulo |the remainder of a / b

|a = b |assignment |sets a to the value of b

|++a |pre-increment |adds 1 to a before the rest of the expression is
evaluated

|a++ |post-increment |adds 1 to a after the rest of the expression is
evaluated

|--a |pre-decrement |subtracts 1 from a before the rest of the
expression is evaluated

|a-- |post-decrement |subtracts 1 from a after the rest of the
expression is evaluated

|a += b |assign with addition |Short for a = a + b

|a -= b |assign with subtraction |Short for a = a - b

|a *= b |assign with multiplication |Short for a = a * b

|a /= b |assign with division |Short for a = a / b

|a %= b |assign with modulo |Short for a = a % b
|=======================================================================

The -- and ++ operators need a little more explanation than is possible in the table. Let's take a look at some code to explain it best.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int a = 1;
	int b = 2;

	// The result here will be 3 because we add 1 to a
	// after a + b is calculated
	printf("a++ + b = %d\n", a++ + b);

	// Because we added 1 to a, this prints a 4.
	printf("a + b = %d\n", a + b);

	// This is 5 because the compiler will add 1 to a before calculating
	// a + b
	printf("++a + b = %d\n", ++a + b);

	return 0;
}
....

Whew! We covered a lot of stuff in this lesson, but using all of it let's us do all sorts of fancy stuff. Let's put it to use.

[source,c++]
....
#include <stdio.h>

// math.h gives us access to a lot of mathematical functions. We're
// including it here so we can access sqrt(), which calculates
// square roots.
#include <math.h>

double hypotenuse(int a, int b)
{
	return sqrt((a*a) + (b*b));
}

int main(void)
{
	int a = 3;
	int b = 4;

	printf("For the triangle with legs %d and %d, the hypotenuse will be %g\n",
		a, b, hypotenuse(a, b));

	return 0;
}
....

`hypotenuse()` returns a `double` because we want some sort of precision
beyond whole numbers. It is also the return type for `sqrt()`.
