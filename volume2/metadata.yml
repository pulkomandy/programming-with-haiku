  This beginning programming guide takes the reader from know next to nothing
  about developing applications for the Haiku operating system to knowing the
  basics and having the skills to go beyond the fundamentals. It begins with
  a traditional "Hello, world! approach, moves through C programming, and
  expands into C++ and programming graphical applications for Haiku.
  Instead of attempting to be an exhaustive C/C++ programming book using Haiku,
  it focuses on application development using the C++ language.
  The Haiku operating system is a great platform for aspiring developers.
  Those who have struggled with learning application development under Linux,
  Microsoft Windows, or Macintosh will find writing programs under Haiku to be
  sensible and easy. The free Paladin integrated development environment for
  Haiku is used for examples in the book.
