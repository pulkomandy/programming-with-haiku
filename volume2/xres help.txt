The first form prints this help text and exits.

The second form lists the resources of all given files.

The third form manipulates the resources of one or more files according to
the given commands.

Valid commands are:
  <input file>
         - Add the resources read from file <input file> to the current
           output file. The file can either be a resource file or an
           executable file.
  -a <type>:<id>[:<name>] ( <file> |  -s <data> )
         - Add a resource to the current output file. The added resource is
           of type <type> and has the ID <id>. If given the resource will
           have name <name>, otherwise it won't have a name. The resource
           data will either be the string <data> provided on the command
           line or the data read from file <file> (the whole contents).
  -d <type>[:<id>]
         - Excludes resources with type <type> and, if given, ID <id> from
           being written to the output file. This applies to all resources
           read from input files or directly specified via command "-a"
           following this command until the next "-d" command.
  -o <output file>
         - Changes the output file to <output file>. All resources specified
           by subsequent <input file> or "-a" commands will be written
           to this file until the next output file is specified via the
           "-o" command. Resources specified later overwrite earlier ones
           with the same type and ID. If <output file> doesn't exist yet, 
           a resource file with the name will be created. If it exists and
           is an executable file, the resources will be added to it (if the
           file already has resources, they will be removed before). If it
           is a resource file or a file of unknown type, it will be
           overwritten with a resource file containing the specified
           resources. The initial output file is "xres.output.rsrc".
           Note that an output file will only be created or modified, if at
           least one <input file> or "-a" command is given for it.
  -x <type>[:<id>]
         - Only resources with type <type> and, if given, ID <id> will be
           written to the output file. This applies to all resources
           read from input files or directly specified via command "-a"
           following this command until the next "-x" command.
  --     - All following arguments, even if starting with a "-" character,
           are treated as input file names.

Parameters:
  <type> - A type constant consisting of exactly four characters.
  <id>   - A positive or negative integer.
